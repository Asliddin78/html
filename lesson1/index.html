 <h1>Nature</h1>
 <p> 
    Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. <i>"Nature"</i> 
    can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
    <mark>The study of nature is a large, if not the</mark> <br> only, part of science. 
    <b>Although humans</b> are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

    The word nature is borrowed from the <u>Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura</u>, or "essential qualities, innate 
    <br> disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek 
    <br> word physis , which originally related to the intrinsic
    <b>characteristics of plants</b>
    animals, and other features of the world to develop of <br> their own accord The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one 
    of several expansions of the original notion; it began with <br> certain core applications of the word by <s>pre-Socratic</s> philosophers (though this 
    word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for <br> Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.
