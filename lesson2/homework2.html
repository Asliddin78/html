        <b>About fruit and vegetables</b> <br><br>
        Fruit and vegetables should be an important part of your daily diet. <br> They are naturally good and contain vitamins and minerals that can help to keep you healthy. 
        They can also help protect against some <br> diseases. <br> <br> Most Australians will benefit from eating more fruit and vegetables as part of a 
        <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/healthy-eating" target="_blank">well-balanced, healthy diet</a> and an 
        <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/healthyliving/keeping-active" target="_blank">active lifestyle</a> . There <br> are many varieties of fruit and vegetables 
        available and many ways to prepare, cook and serve them. <br> Fruit and vegetables are best bought when they are in season. Otherwise try frozen or canned vegetables as 
        they are just as nutritious <br> and budget-friendly as well. <br> You should eat at least 5 serves of vegetables and 2 serves of fruit each day. Choose different colours 
        and varieties. <br> If you are someone who doesn't look forward to eating fruit or vegetables, start slowly with those you do like. Try serving, flavouring or <br> cooking them 
        in different ways. You can also disguise them in sauces, minced meals or curries <br> <br>

        <b>Vitamins and minerals in fruit and vegetables</b> <br><br>
        Fruits and vegetables contain many <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Vitamins-and-minerals" target="_blank">vitamins and minerals</a> that are good for your health. <br>
        Many of these are <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/Vitamins-and-minerals" target="">antioxidants</a> , and may reduce the risk of many diseases:
        <ul> 
            <li>vitamin A (beta-carotene)</li>
            <li>vitamin C</li>
            <li>vitamin E</li>
            <li>magnesium</li>
            <li>zinc</li>
            <li>phosphorous</li>
            <li>folic acid.</li>
        </ul>

        Folic acid may reduce blood levels of homocysteine, a substance that may be a risk factor for coronary heart disease. <br>
        Research has shown that consuming these nutrients as food, within fruits and vegetables, is more beneficial for health than consuming <br> them as 
        <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/vitamin-and-minerals" target="_blank">supplements.</a>  <br>
